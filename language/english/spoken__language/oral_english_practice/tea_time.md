Tea_time is a small meal eaten in the late afternoon(usually between about 3:30 and 5:00).    
People may drink tea, and often eat biscuits, cakes or savoury foods such as sandwiches,     
crumpets or tea-cakes. Occasionally people may have a full afternoon tea or a cream  tea:    
this includes a scone with jam and cream as well as a selection of sandwiches and cakes.
